# Security Review Report - PlanPal AI

## Executive Summary

This security review identifies several critical vulnerabilities in the PlanPal AI application that require immediate attention. The most severe issues include hardcoded credentials, weak authentication mechanisms, and lack of proper security controls.

## Critical Vulnerabilities (High Priority)

### 1. Hardcoded Password in Source Code
**Location:** `src/components/auth-guard.tsx:25`
- **Issue:** Password "SmarterAI2025" is hardcoded as a fallback
- **Risk:** Anyone with access to the source code can bypass authentication
- **Recommendation:** Remove hardcoded credentials immediately and use environment variables exclusively

### 2. Weak Authentication System
**Location:** `src/components/auth-guard.tsx`
- **Issue:** Single shared password stored in localStorage without encryption
- **Risk:** No user-specific authentication, vulnerable to localStorage manipulation
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper user authentication with Supabase Auth

### 3. Exposed Sensitive Information in Console Logs
**Location:** `src/components/login-form.tsx:16`
- **Issue:** Password logged to console in plain text
- **Risk:** Credentials exposed in browser developer tools
- **Recommendation:** Remove all console.log statements containing sensitive data

### 4. Missing API Authentication
**Locations:** 
- `src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/send-sms/route.ts`
- **Issue:** No authentication checks on API endpoints
- **Risk:** Anyone can send emails/SMS through your API
- **Recommendation:** Add authentication middleware to verify requests

## High Priority Issues

### 5. Insecure Data Storage
**Location:** Multiple files using localStorage
- **Issue:** Sensitive plan and RSVP data stored in localStorage without encryption
- **Risk:** Data accessible to any JavaScript code, persists after logout
- **Recommendation:** Use secure server-side storage or encrypt sensitive data

### 6. Missing Input Validation
**Locations:** API routes and form handlers
- **Issue:** Limited validation on user inputs
- **Risk:** Potential for injection attacks and data integrity issues
- **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas

### 7. No Rate Limiting
**Locations:** API endpoints
- **Issue:** No rate limiting on email/SMS endpoints
- **Risk:** Potential for abuse, spam, and resource exhaustion
- **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting middleware

## Medium Priority Issues

### 8. Missing Security Headers
**Location:** `next.config.ts`
- **Issue:** No security headers configured
- **Risk:** Missing protections against clickjacking, XSS, etc.
- **Recommendation:** Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### 9. Sensitive Data in HTML Email
**Location:** `src/app/api/send-email/route.ts`
- **Issue:** Share codes sent in plain text emails
- **Risk:** Email interception could expose event access
- **Recommendation:** Consider time-limited tokens or additional verification

### 10. Client-Side Routing Without Protection
**Location:** Various pages
- **Issue:** Some routes lack authentication checks
- **Risk:** Unauthorized access to protected pages
- **Recommendation:** Implement route guards on all protected pages

## Positive Security Findings

1. **No SQL Injection Risks:** Using Supabase ORM prevents direct SQL injection
2. **No XSS Vulnerabilities:** React's built-in protections are properly utilized
3. **Dependency Security:** No known vulnerabilities in dependencies (npm audit clean)
4. **HTTPS Usage:** Proper use of HTTPS for external API calls

## Recommended Security Improvements

### Immediate Actions (Do First)
1. Remove hardcoded password from `auth-guard.tsx`
2. Remove console.log statements exposing passwords
3. Add authentication to API endpoints
4. Implement proper user authentication with Supabase

### Short-term Improvements
1. Add rate limiting to API endpoints
2. Implement proper session management
3. Add security headers in `next.config.ts`
4. Encrypt sensitive data in localStorage or move to server-side storage

### Long-term Enhancements
1. Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
2. Add audit logging for security events
3. Set up security monitoring and alerting
4. Conduct regular security audits

## Sample Security Header Configuration

Add to `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
const securityHeaders = [
  {
    key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',
    value: 'on'
  },
  {
    key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
    value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload'
  },
  {
    key: 'X-XSS-Protection',
    value: '1; mode=block'
  },
  {
    key: 'X-Frame-Options',
    value: 'SAMEORIGIN'
  },
  {
    key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
    value: 'nosniff'
  },
  {
    key: 'Referrer-Policy',
    value: 'origin-when-cross-origin'
  }
]
```

## Conclusion

While the application has some good security practices in place, the critical vulnerabilities identified pose significant risks. The hardcoded password and lack of API authentication are the most urgent issues to address. Implementing the recommended fixes will significantly improve the application's security posture.
